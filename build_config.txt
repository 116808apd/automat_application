Currently the pack is being build with mingw gcc compiler and boost included.

In order to get this to work in eclipse the following is required:
- Mingw gcc compiler
- Installation of boost Version 1.61.0

Settings in eclipse:
- Go to Project properties (alt+enter).
- Go to C/C++ General/Paths and Symbols. 
- In the Includes tab, press the GNU C++ and include the boost library (in my case: C:\boost\include)
- In the Library Paths tab add the stage/lib path of boost (in my case: C:\Users\nicov\Documents\HAN\OSM-S\boost\boost_1_61_0\boost_1_61_0\stage\lib)
- In libraries the following lines are added: 	boost_filesystem-mt
						boost_system-met
Please note that the configuration might differ on your local PC.
